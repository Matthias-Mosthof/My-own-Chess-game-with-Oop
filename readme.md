# Creating Chess

### Note

This project is there to use quite a range of what I know so far about HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It isnt there to copy any existing project on this subject as I do this to learn Coding. Everything I do is using my own knowledge and also looking up general methods in documentations to learn how to use them.

## Progress

04.11.22: Creating the Chess Board using Grid-Areas. These are 64 areas as the Chess Board consists of 8 x 8 fields.
05.11.22: Placing the White and Black Pieces in the starting Position.

## Goal

A fully working chess game with all its mechanics for 2 Players.
